# Python!

In this repo I showcase all of my learning towards mastering python. From the basics to algorithms and more. Through useful resources I was able to grasp these concepts seamlessly and transfer the knowledge to the project building
phase. BroCode on ðŸ“º YouTube helped really understand the inner workings of Python and increase confidence towards my development carreer.

Keep on coding!
